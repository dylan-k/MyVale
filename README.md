# MyVale
My collection of styleguide rules to use with Vale while writing.

## Installation

- clone this repo into your `~/.config/vale/` directory
- hardlink the config file from this working directory to its required location.  
`ln ~/.config/vale/.vale.ini ~/.vale.ini`
- note the stylespath in that file, revise as needed

## Extra Settings

alias in `~/.bash_aliases` file to quickly edit Vale settings.  
`alias vale="cd ~/.config/vale/ && subl ."`

TODO:

- remove redundant rules
- combine into one custom style
- add readability rules
- check for headings in title case
- add a good example doc for testing
